'''
Write a program that creates a loop asking the user to input a number.

    Repeat this process until the user enters the value end.

        The following can be used to loop through the user input.

prompt = "Enter a number (or the word 'end' to quit) "
while True:
    data = input(prompt)
    if data == "end":
        break
    #Remainder of while loop goes here

    Add each iteration number to a list.

    Just before the program ends, print the following:

        The contents of the list on one line

        The sum of the elements in the list on the second line
