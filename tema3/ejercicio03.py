'''
Write a program that creates a loop asking the user to input a number.

    Repeat this process until the user enters the value end.

    Enter each number into a set.

        Before you enter the number, verify if the number is already in the set.

        If the number is already in the set, then update a counter that tracks how many entries are not added to the set.

    Just before the program ends, print the following:

        The contents of the set on one line

        The number of elements that were NOT added to the set on the second line
